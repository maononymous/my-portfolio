    subtitle: 'Curious Developer | Creative Technologist',
    planetId: 0,
    dnaContent: `My name is Abdullah Omer Mohammed. I hold a Master’s degree in Computer Science from DePaul University in Chicago, where I spent a few years learning, building, and figuring out how I like to work. I enjoy understanding how things work. Sometimes that’s code. Sometimes it’s noticing patterns in numbers, or figuring out why a photo feels right, or why a system feels awkward to use. I tend to gravitate toward problems where logic and intuition meet. I like building software across layers. Mobile apps, web interfaces, backend logic, and the glue that connects them. iOS development is something I enjoy deeply because it makes design decisions feel immediate and visible, but I’m just as comfortable working on Android, web apps, or backend-heavy systems where the satisfaction comes from clean logic and structure. Outside of code, I spend time cycling, cooking, and staying active. Those aren’t breaks from thinking. They help me reset and come back with better judgment. I build things because I want to see them exist, and I keep refining them until they feel settled.`,

  planetId: 1,
  dnaContent: `These four years were where things really started to click for me. I wasn’t just learning how to code, I was learning how to sit with problems and work through them until something made sense. A lot of trial, a lot of small builds, and plenty of things breaking before they worked. Outside academics, I was involved with Matrusri Campus Connect, the student chapter responsible for organizing and hosting the college’s cultural, festive, and annual events. I worked on event coordination and handled design and social media promotions. It was a good balance to the technical side of college life, working with people, deadlines, and real-world constraints alongside coursework.`,
  planetContent: `My coursework and projects covered core computer science foundations, with regular hands-on work in <button class="skill" data-skill="Java" type="button">Java</button>, <button class="skill" data-skill="C++" type="button">C++</button>, and <button class="skill" data-skill="Python" type="button">Python</button>. I spent a lot of time on <button class="skill" data-skill="Data Structures and Algorithms" type="button">Data Structures and Algorithms</button>, which shaped how I approach performance and problem-solving. I also built Java-based applications that integrated <button class="skill" data-skill="REST APIs" type="button">REST APIs</button> with <button class="skill" data-skill="SQL" type="button">SQL</button> databases, and explored frameworks like <button class="skill" data-skill="Spring MVC" type="button">Spring MVC</button> and <button class="skill" data-skill="React.js" type="button">React.js</button>.

    title: 'APROR',
    subtitle: 'Team-based exploration and prototyping <br>December 2018 | Hyderabad, India',
    planetId: 2,
    dnaContent: `APROR started as a group of five friends who liked building things together and seeing how far an idea could go. Over time, it became more serious. Hackathons, competitions, deadlines, and the pressure to make something work in a limited window. We participated in a lot of hackathons over the years. Some were chaotic, some were intense, and most went surprisingly well. Winning became part of the story, but it was never the starting point. What mattered more was learning how to think fast, divide work, argue productively, and still ship something coherent by the end. SfUIT came out of this phase and stands out enough to deserve its own section later. But it wasn’t an exception. It was the result of everything we had already been doing together, repeatedly, under pressure.`,
    planetContent: `Within APROR, I mostly worked on backend and logic-heavy parts of our hackathon builds, using <button class="skill" data-skill="Java" type="button">Java</button>, <button class="skill" data-skill="JavaScript" type="button">JavaScript</button>, <button class="skill" data-skill="SQL" type="button">SQL</button>, and <button class="skill" data-skill="C#" type="button">C#</button>. I focused on core logic, data handling, and making sure different parts of the system stayed aligned under tight timelines. We regularly built full-stack prototypes from scratch for competitions, using tools like <button class="skill" data-skill="Arduino" type="button">Arduino</button> for hardware-based ideas and <button class="skill" data-skill="Figma" type="button">Figma</button> to quickly plan flows and interfaces. These projects had to work, not just look good. That environment forced clarity, prioritization, and fast decision-making, habits that still carry over into how I build today.`,

    title: 'Speed Limit Assistant',
    subtitle: 'Speed Monitoring Mobile App <br>June 2020 - August 2020 | Hyderabad, India',
    planetId: 3,
    dnaContent: `Speed Limit Assistant was a small group project we built during undergrad. The idea came from noticing how easy it is to cross the speed limit without realizing it, especially when you’re driving on unfamiliar roads. The app tracked the road you were on and checked the speed limit for that stretch. If your speed crossed that limit, the interface changed and made it obvious that something was off. We spent more time than expected getting that behavior to feel consistent, because location data, speed readings, and map information don’t always agree with each other in real time. I worked mostly on the logic side of the project, figuring out how to combine the different inputs and decide when the app should react. Like most student projects, everyone helped wherever needed. We tested it a lot, adjusted edge cases, and put together the final demo as a team. It stayed simple in concept, but it exposed a lot of practical issues that don’t show up in theory.`,
    planetContent: `Speed Limit Assistant was developed as an Android application using Android Studio. The app used the device’s <button class="skill" data-skill="GPS" type="button">GPS</button> to determine the user’s current location and queried the <button class="skill" data-skill="HereMap API" type="button">HereMap API</button> to retrieve the speed limit for the corresponding road. The user’s speed was calculated continuously from location updates and sensor data, then compared against the retrieved limit. When the threshold was crossed, the UI reflected that change immediately. I implemented most of the logic that handled sensor input, API responses, comparison conditions, and state changes, and helped connect that logic to the interface so the behavior stayed predictable. Working on this project gave me early experience with real-time data, external APIs, and the kind of edge cases that appear once you move beyond controlled examples.`,

    subtitle: 'Assistive Technology Summit | Telangana State Innovation Cell <br>November 2021 - January 2022 | Hyderabad, India',
    planetId: 4,
    dnaContent: `SfUIT (pronounced "Suit") was a project developed under APROR as part of an assistive technology effort. The idea was to design a wearable system that could monitor basic health vitals and assist users during emergency situations. The project was showcased at the Assistive Technology Summit organized by the Telangana State Innovation Cell, where it went through numerous levels of showcasing along with more than 500 other participating teams, and eventually received second place and a ₹150,000 award. During the showcase, we also collected interest from potential users for early testing, which helped validate the usefulness of the concept beyond a demo environment. SfUIT stands out to me because it pushed past prototypes and into something that had to make sense to people outside our immediate circle.`,
    planetContent: `SfUIT (Smart fabricia Using Internet of Things) was a health-monitoring wearable built as an IoT system using an <button class="skill" data-skill="ESP32" type="button">ESP32</button> microcontroller and multiple sensors to track heartbeat, oxygen saturation, body temperature, altitude, and fall events. I worked primarily on the embedded logic written in <button class="skill" data-skill="C#" type="button">C#</button>, handling sensor data acquisition, filtering, and real-time processing. The device connected to a web interface built with <button class="skill" data-skill="React.js" type="button">React.js</button> and a companion Android application that allowed caregivers or medical staff to monitor vitals remotely. The system supported emergency triggers that could notify caretakers and share the user’s live location when thresholds were crossed. I contributed across the stack, including sensor validation, backend integration, and technical demos.`,

    title: 'Player Orbit',
    subtitle: 'Backend Developer Intern <br>January 2022 - March 2022 | Hyderabad, India',
    planetId: 5,
    dnaContent: `Player Orbit was my first experience working inside a small company environment. When I joined, they were in the middle of narrowing their focus. What started as a broader idea around gaming and learning was being refined into something more specific: teaching chess to kids. I joined as a backend developer intern and worked closely with the core team during this transition phase. It was a shift from the pace of college projects. Requirements were clearer, changes had real impact, and the work had to fit into an existing product rather than stand alone. That experience gave me a practical view of how software development works in a professional setting. Fewer abstractions, more constraints, and a stronger emphasis on coordination and reliability.`,
    planetContent: `During my internship at Player Orbit, I worked on backend services related to user authentication and session management for the platform. I contributed to designing and implementing login flows and helped structure the user data models that supported the application. We worked with secure authentication flows using <button class="skill" data-skill="OAuth2.0" type="button">OAuth2.0</button> and focused on keeping the backend flexible enough to support the company’s shift toward a chess-focused learning product. My work involved API design, access control, and understanding how different backend services interact within a growing system. This role gave me early exposure to production-oriented backend development, where stability, clarity, and long-term maintainability mattered more than experimentation.`,

    title: 'Anonymous Data Sharing Scheme',
    subtitle: 'Medical Data Sharing System using Diffie-Hellman Algorithm <br>March 2022 - April 2022 | Hyderabad, India',
    planetId: 1,
    dnaContent: `This was our final semester project, done by the same three-person group that worked on the Speed Limit Assistant earlier. The focus this time was more academic and slower-paced, centered on understanding how sensitive data can be shared securely over public networks. We used medical data as the example, mainly patient vitals, because it made the problem concrete and easy to reason about. The project forced us to think carefully about trust, key exchange, and what actually keeps data safe when communication channels aren’t private. I focused on the core logic and backend flow, while the others handled the UI and presentation. Seeing cryptographic concepts move from theory into something that actually ran was the most satisfying part of the process.`,
    planetContent: `The project implemented secure data exchange using the <button class="skill" data-skill="Diffie-Hellman Algorithm" type="button">Diffie-Hellman Algorithm</button> to establish a shared secret over a public channel. This shared key was then used to encrypt and decrypt transmitted medical data between two simulated endpoints. My work centered on the backend logic, including key generation, secure exchange handling, and ensuring that encrypted data could only be interpreted by parties that successfully completed the key negotiation. A simple UI was used to demonstrate inputs and outputs, but the focus remained on correctness and protocol flow rather than interface complexity. Working on this project strengthened my understanding of secure communication, key exchange mechanisms, and the practical challenges involved in designing privacy-aware systems.`,

    dnaContent: `Abdul Bari Pvt Ltd is an edtech company focused on programming education. I worked there full-time as a software developer and was responsible for building the company’s learning platform from the ground up. My work focused on designing and implementing the core system that students used to access courses, navigate content, and complete enrollments. This involved making early architectural decisions, wiring features end to end, and bringing the platform to a point where it was stable, usable, and ready for real users. Once the platform reached that stage, my development work on the system was largely complete. The next phase of my time there shifted into a different role altogether, which is covered separately in the next section.`,
    planetContent: `At Abdul Bari Pvt Ltd, I designed and built the company’s <button class="skill" data-skill="Learning Management System" type="button">Learning Management System (LMS)</button> from the ground up. The platform handled course access, enrollment flows, and content delivery for students.

    dnaContent: `After the platform was built and live, my role shifted into a course assistant position for several of the programs hosted on it. This work was focused on the learning side rather than development. I helped with tasks like refining video content, preparing assignment drafts, and responding to student questions through course discussion forums. The scale was large, and the work required consistency more than creativity. Students expected clear answers and quick turnaround, and that became the priority. Being on the academic side of the platform gave me a different view of how technical content is consumed at scale, and what actually helps learners when they get stuck.`,
    planetContent: `In this role, I supported the delivery of multiple online programming courses focused on <button class="skill" data-skill="Data Structures and Algorithms" type="button">Data Structures and Algorithms</button>, <button class="skill" data-skill="Java" type="button">Java</button>, and <button class="skill" data-skill="C++" type="button">C++</button>, with a combined enrollment of over 500,000 students across platforms like Udemy. My responsibilities included reviewing and refining recorded content, assisting with assignment design drafts, and handling technical questions through course Q&A forums. I regularly clarified concepts, addressed edge-case questions, and helped maintain consistency in explanations across the courses. This role strengthened my ability to communicate technical ideas clearly, respond precisely to questions, and support large-scale learning without oversimplifying the material.`,

    dnaContent: `I appeared for GATE 2023 in Computer Science and secured an All India Rank of 200 in my first attempt. I prepared for it over roughly eight months while handling other responsibilities alongside it. The preparation itself was mostly routine. Studying concepts, solving problems, revising mistakes, and repeating the cycle. Some weeks were productive, some weren’t. I stuck to it anyway. And yes, there was a lot of biryani involved during that phase. Getting the result felt good, but more importantly, it confirmed that sustained effort over a long period is something I can handle without needing constant momentum.`,
    planetContent: `I followed a full-syllabus approach during preparation, making sure no subject was left completely untouched. I was relatively comfortable with <button class="skill" data-skill="Engineering Mathematics" type="button">Engineering Mathematics</button> and <button class="skill" data-skill="General Aptitude" type="button">General Aptitude</button>, which helped keep the overall score stable.

    planetId: 4,
    dnaContent: `I completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science at DePaul University in Chicago. Moving here meant adjusting to a new country, a new city, and a different way of living, all at once. I’ve always liked Apple’s ecosystem and iOS development, so I intentionally chose iOS-focused courses during the program. I enjoyed building apps, learning how the platform is structured, and spending time on details that affect how an app actually behaves on a device. That interest stayed consistent throughout the degree and showed up across multiple projects. Life outside classes mattered just as much. Cycling along the Lakefront Trail became routine. The gym and rec center were regular stops. Campus events were active and easy to walk into, and I tried to attend when I could. Over time, Chicago stopped feeling temporary and started feeling familiar. I also worked on campus during this period, which added structure to my weeks. Balancing coursework, work, and everyday life in a new environment forced me to be deliberate with time and priorities. During the Master’s, I worked on several projects and held campus roles alongside academics, which are covered in the sections that follow.`,
    planetContent: `My coursework at DePaul covered systems, application development, and design-focused computing.

    planetId: 3,
    dnaContent: `This was a solo backend project I built as part of my Object-Oriented Programming course. It was a command-line car rental management system that handled core operations like listing cars, checking availability, calculating rental costs, and recording bookings. Working on it alone meant making all the design decisions myself. Defining the data model, deciding how responsibilities should be split across classes, and making sure changes in one part didn’t break another. Most of the effort went into getting the structure right and keeping the logic predictable as the system grew. It wasn’t flashy, but it worked end to end, and it forced me to think carefully about how a real system should be organized.`,
    planetContent: `The Car Rental System was a CLI-based application developed in <button class="skill" data-skill="Java" type="button">Java</button>, built around core object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation.

    planetId: 1,
    dnaContent: `This was a solo project I built for SE450 as part of an optional bonus assignment. I took it up out of interest and ended up building a complete static analysis tool rather than a minimal submission. The tool pulled public Git repositories, analyzed Java source files for code issues, and presented the results visually. The focus was on making the flow end to end: fetching code, running analysis, storing results, and showing something useful at the end. It was the first project where I wasn’t just building an application for a user, but a tool meant to help developers reason about code quality.`,
    planetContent: `This was a standalone static analysis and visualization tool developed in <button class="skill" data-skill="Java" type="button">Java</button>. The application used <button class="skill" data-skill="JGit" type="button">JGit</button> to clone public GitHub repositories and extract Java source files for analysis.

The idea was simple on paper: take a keyword from a client and return the top files that contain it the most. Making that work at scale was a different story. I set everything up on a Linux virtual machine and worked with large CSV files that quickly exposed performance issues if I wasn’t careful. A lot of the time went into figuring out how to structure the search so it didn’t feel painfully slow, and how to split work across threads without breaking things. It was one of those projects where nothing worked on the first try. Or the second. Debugging client–server communication, dealing with concurrency issues, and chasing down subtle bugs became part of the process.

    dnaContent: 'This was a solo project I built for my Web Applications course. I wanted to create a task management tool that stayed out of the user’s way and didn’t try to do too much. The app let users create tasks, group them, add tags, and set deadlines, all in a way that felt lightweight and quick to use. I spent most of my time thinking about how someone would actually interact with it day to day, rather than adding features just because I could. There was no backend involved. Everything lived in the browser using local storage, which turned out to be enough for what the app was meant to do.

    dnaContent: 'JeevIT started as something I built for myself. I wanted a faster, more intentional way to track my health without juggling multiple apps. Over time, it grew into a full wellness tracker that I actually used every day. The app tracks meals, water intake, exercise, steps, and weight, pulling real data from my Apple Watch and the Health app. What kept me coming back to it wasn’t just the data, but how it felt to use. The graphs, color themes, and progress rings gave it a sense of rhythm and personality instead of feeling like a dashboard. Because I was solving my own problem, iteration came naturally. I kept adjusting flows, visuals, and data presentation until the app felt right to open daily. It ended up being less about tracking numbers and more about building something that fit into my routine without friction.',

    dnaContent: 'IWasHere was a personal project I built out of curiosity. I wanted to see if I could combine photography with a clean, intentional mobile UI and turn it into something lightweight and fun. The idea was simple. Users pick a themed overlay, currently country-based, take a photo, and then decide whether to keep it. If they do, the share sheet opens immediately so the image can be saved or sent out. I liked the idea of keeping the flow short and decisive, no editing screens, no extra steps. Most of the challenge wasn’t the idea itself, but getting the camera and UI layers to work together cleanly. Making sure custom frames aligned correctly, behaved consistently across devices, and didn’t break the capture experience took more effort than I expected. It ended up being one of those projects where the simplicity on the surface hid a lot of detail underneath.',

    dnaContent: 'Filing taxes in the U.S. as an international student felt unnecessarily confusing, and that frustration is what pushed this project forward. TaxMate started as an academic project, but very quickly became something more serious once we realized how many students were dealing with the same problem. The goal was to make the process less intimidating. Step by step guidance, clear inputs, and no assumptions about prior knowledge. Users can upload their W-2 forms, enter academic and immigration details, and walk through the required IRS paperwork without having to decode tax jargon on their own. This project stood out because it was structured and purpose-driven. A lot of time went into understanding the rules, edge cases, and constraints around F-1 tax filing, not just building screens. It felt like a mix of research, system design, and empathy, all coming together in one place.',

I continue to be someone the office relies on, but now it\'s more about diving deeper into the rhythms of course planning, keeping an eye on enrollments, and stepping in when students or instructors need help. It\'s quieter work in some ways, but also more structured, and I\'m enjoying that shift.',

This version was built specifically for Android, using Android Studio, without reusing the web code. The core concept stayed the same: lightweight task creation, grouping, tags, and deadlines. What changed was how everything had to be thought through again for mobile. Navigation, state handling, and persistence all felt different compared to the browser.

The goal was to explore a large public dataset and present it in a way that felt usable and responsive on a phone. The app lets users search for artworks from the Art Institute of Chicago’s collection, browse results visually, and dive into details without feeling overwhelmed. I spent a lot of time getting the flow right: searching, loading states, error handling, and smooth navigation between screens. The random artwork feature was especially fun to build because it forced me to think beyond simple query–response logic. It was one of those builds where small details mattered. Handling edge cases, making sure the UI didn’t break in landscape mode, and keeping navigation predictable ended up being just as important as getting the API calls right.',

    dnaContent: `This portfolio sits outside the timeline. It holds everything together without belonging to any single phase. The DNA mode is directly inspired by Assassin’s Creed — the idea of navigating memory itself. The interface borrows from the Animus-style framing, where progress isn’t linear and meaning lives across layers. Even the menu reflects this, using a DNA strand structure to move between different rungs of the same larger story. Planet mode takes its cue from the MCU’s cosmic framing, where multiple storylines coexist at scale. Each project becomes part of a larger system rather than a standalone moment, connected through structure instead of chronology. The two modes exist side by side, separated by a movable boundary, inspired by Split Fiction. The same content lives in both, but the lens changes. Neither mode replaces the other. They’re meant to coexist, just like the timelines they represent. This isn’t a conclusion or an explanation. It’s simply the frame that keeps all timelines in place.`,
